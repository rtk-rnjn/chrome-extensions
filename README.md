## Codetantra - Copy Code

Since the text area of the Codetantra website do not allow us to copy the text. But it can be copied just by few simple JS code. So I made this extension to do that for me.

### How to use

Just download the extension, and whenever you open the Codetantra website, the extension will automatically add a `Copy Code` button.

## YouTube Bookmarker

This extension allows you to bookmark the current time of the video you are watching. And you can jump to that time by clicking on the bookmark.

### How to use

Just download the extension, and whenever you open a YouTube video, the extension will automatically add a `Bookmark` button in (+) like icon. Click on it to bookmark the current time. And click on the bookmark to jump to that time.
